        Garage name

        Price per hour

        Distance

        Available spots

        Rating

Booking Confirmation:
After clicking "Book Now", a confirmation page will display:

    A countdown timer (e.g., 2 minutes)

QR Code System:

    Once a booking is confirmed, you will receive a unique QR Code.

    The QR Code can be found on the booking confirmation page and in your Current Bookings section.

    How it works:

        At entry: A garage employee scans your QR Code to record the check-in time.

        At exit: The QR Code is scanned again to record the check-out time.

        The app automatically calculates the parking duration and final cost.

    WALLET & PAYMENTS

Payment Process:

    Payment is automatically deducted from your wallet balance if sufficient funds exist.
